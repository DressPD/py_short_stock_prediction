# short_stock_prediction

- Python model to analyze and predict value of stocks in the short term and rudimental deployment on server

- This project has to be intended as made by a beginner, the scope was trying to update a more complex repository on my GitHub profile

- On the other hand, I have tried to optimize a short and simple model in order to forecast stock values in the near future to have a vision of the possible market trends and generate useful insights

- Suggestions and opinions are always appreciated
